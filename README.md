## PROJECT SUMMARY :

Created a movie app application where a user can create movies and reference them when they need to. 

## APPROACH TAKEN :

Started created my components first then I added them to my app.js. I used material-ui for some of my frontend designs.

## DIFFICULTIES

- My update and delete button were not functioning. Didn't realize it was an error through the backend.
- When using material-ui I was struggling to add css to it.
